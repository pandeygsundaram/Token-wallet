# Token Wallet on ICP Blockchain

## Overview
This project is a secure and feature-rich token wallet implemented in Rust for the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain. The wallet supports essential functionalities such as sending and receiving ICRC2 tokens, querying balances, and fetching metadata.

## Features
- **Send Tokens**: Transfer tokens from one user to another securely.
- **Receive Tokens**: Update wallet balance upon receiving tokens.
- **Balance Display**: Query and display the token balance for a specific user.
- **Total Supply Query**: Fetch the total token supply.
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling for insufficient funds, invalid recipients, and other edge cases.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Rust programming language installed.
- DFX SDK (for deploying on the Internet Computer) installed.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pandeygsundaram/Token-wallet
cd Token-wallet
```

### 3. Build the Project
Compile the Rust code:
```bash
cargo build
```

### 4. Deploy to Local ICP Network
Start the local ICP network and deploy the canister:
```bash
dfx start --background
dfx deploy
```

### 5. Interact with the Smart Contract
Once deployed, you can interact with the token wallet through the following queries and updates:

#### Query Token Metadata
Fetch metadata such as name, symbol, decimals, and fee:
```rust
let metadata = icrc2_metadata();
```

#### Get Balance
Query the balance of a specific user:
```rust
let balance = icrc2_balance_of(principal);
```

#### Send Tokens
Transfer tokens from one user to another:
```rust
let result = icrc2_transfer(to, amount);
```

#### Total Supply
Fetch the total supply of the token:
```rust
let total_supply = icrc2_total_supply();
```

### 6. Running Tests
You can run the unit tests to validate the functionality of the wallet:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Functionality

### Token Wallet
The `TokenWallet` struct is the core of the wallet, storing token balances and metadata. Key fields include:
- **balances**: A `HashMap` storing user balances identified by their Principal.
- **total_supply**: The total supply of tokens (e.g., 1,000,000,000 tokens).
- **name**: The token name (e.g., "MyToken").
- **symbol**: The token symbol (e.g., "MTK").
- **decimals**: Number of decimals (e.g., 8).

### Functions
- **`icrc2_metadata`**: Retrieves token metadata.
- **`icrc2_balance_of`**: Returns the balance of a specific user.
- **`icrc2_transfer`**: Transfers tokens between users.
- **`icrc2_total_supply`**: Returns the total token supply.

### Error Handling
- **InsufficientFunds**: Raised when the sender has insufficient tokens.
- **InvalidRecipient**: Raised when the recipientâ€™s address is invalid.

### Example Usage
#### Create a New Token Wallet
```rust
let token_wallet = TokenWallet::new();
```

#### Query User Balance
```rust
let balance = token_wallet.get_balance(principal);
```

#### Transfer Tokens
```rust
let result = icrc2_transfer(recipient, 50);
```

#### Fetch Metadata
```rust
let metadata = icrc2_metadata();
```

## Testing
The project includes unit tests to validate:
- **Initial Balance**: Verifies a new wallet has an initial balance of 0 tokens.
- **Transfer Success**: Checks that transfers update balances correctly.
- **Transfer Failure**: Validates error handling for insufficient funds and invalid recipients.
- **Metadata Query**: Ensures correct fetching of metadata.
- **Total Supply Query**: Verifies the total token supply.

To run the tests:
```bash
cargo test
```
